    abstract = "{This paper studies the use of emotion and reason in political discourse. Adopting computational-linguistics techniques to construct a validated text-based scale, we measure emotionality in six million speeches given in U.S. Congress over the years 1858–2014. Intuitively, emotionality spikes during times of war and is highest in speeches about patriotism. In the time series, emotionality was relatively low and stable in earlier years but increased significantly starting in the late 1970s. Across Congress members, emotionality is higher for Democrats, for women, for ethnic/religious minorities, for the opposition party and for members with ideologically extreme roll-call voting records.}",

between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). The words have
been manually labeled by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen in 2009-2011. The file
is tab-separated. There are two versions:

 {AFINN-}111: Newest version with 2477 words and phrases.

 {AFINN-}96: 1468 unique words and phrases on 1480 lines. Note that there
are 1480 lines, as some words are listed twice. The word list in not
entirely in alphabetic ordering.  

An evaluation of the word list is available in:
