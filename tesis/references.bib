    abstract = "{This paper studies the use of emotion and reason in political discourse. Adopting computational-linguistics techniques to construct a validated text-based scale, we measure emotionality in six million speeches given in U.S. Congress over the years 1858–2014. Intuitively, emotionality spikes during times of war and is highest in speeches about patriotism. In the time series, emotionality was relatively low and stable in earlier years but increased significantly starting in the late 1970s. Across Congress members, emotionality is higher for Democrats, for women, for ethnic/religious minorities, for the opposition party and for members with ideologically extreme roll-call voting records.}",

    abstract = { The joint initiation of legislation is one of the most important forms of collaboration within Congress, and the nature of such relations may affect its responsiveness. Through social network analysis, this article analyses the evolution of cohesion and polarization of policy networks for the Chilean Lower House from 2006 until 2017, comparing those derived from all bills from those that emerge when considering only successful ones. Although scholars consider that initiation of legislation is mostly free of party discipline or policy gatekeeping, networks recovered from all bills despite being highly cohesive replicate the roll-call divisions during all years under analysis. Among networks derived from successful bills – those able to overcome policy gatekeeping, collaboration crosses the ideological divide. These results imply that agenda setting plays a different role on policy collaboration than on voting and emphasize the relevance of the partisan dimension in agenda setting influence presented by Tsebelis and Aleman. Whereas the institutional prerogatives in the Lower House did not change after 2006, the partisan configuration did, which might explain the different degree of polarization among networks of successful bills found before 2006 by other studies. }

Esta ausencia de inercia institucional impone un desafío para que la toma de decisiones colectivas genere equilibrios estables. Como tal, es un escenario propicio para estudiar el surgimiento de acción colectiva a partir de las preferencias ideológicas de los miembros del cuerpo colegiado. En este estudio se estiman las ideologías de los convencionales a partir del primer mes de votaciones plenarias y se utilizan para testear si la ideología ayuda a explicar las decisiones de copatrocinio de iniciativas dentro del organismo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
